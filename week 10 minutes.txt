Agenda:
Decide on the project




Notes:
Planning project:


Final idea:
1. stock verification mode
  	Our system will count every item that gets delivered to verify the stock received is correct.
	uses magnometer - consider 3 different items, 3 different sized magnetic 'barcodes' (just different sized magnets) to determine which item
	
2. Object detection/mapping mode
	As a user chucks items from a truck into a pit, our system will scan the setting using a lidar and send coordinates of the objects to an 
	external robotic arm to collect
   

	
A button will switch between modes


Action items:
Try running stewart's code/breaking stuff into modules
Get the lidar and servos scanning in 2D and convert to correct data
Use the servo position to calculate azimuth
