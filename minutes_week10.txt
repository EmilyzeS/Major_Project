Agenda:

Finalise idea
Take initial measurements

Notes:


Brainstorming
Initial idea too simple
More complex:

on trolley - press buttons to say what item looking for
will give directions to this item
3D pattern on ceiling - once goes into navigation mode will point at ceiling to determine which aisle in
Uses
stabilising (on trolley)

On trolley - if going to hit something loud sound/led

Mapping?? What is mapping useful for

Robot has items sorted into aisles - drops off items in aisle
magnets of same size at start of each aisle - counts peaks of magnetic strength




Final Idea:

Object gets put in rectangle - lidar maps to detect xy coodrinates
IMU tells how strong magnet is - does stock take - also have separate mode of on trolley scanning price of items 
File report of stock

((falls off conveyer belt - can detect if fell off))

Object detection:
lidar + magnet scans what items in trolley

Stock take:

Problems in supermarket to solve?:
Getting stuff off truck
Stock take - checking what stock is empty
updating stock
trolley traffic
finding items in store
adding prices of what is in trolley
scanning items to pay





Modules:

PROCESS DATA

Matlab mapping
solving xy coordinates from map

serial - sending to python/matlab
filtering data? lidar

accelerometer? data - check pan/tilt moving where supposed to
magnometer data filter


python interface
writing files with data summary

stock take (magnometer data process)

lights/sounds on dragonboard
