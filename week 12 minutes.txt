Agenda:
Get the object detection working
Get the object classification using magnets working




Notes:
During the lab, we decided to use gyroscope data to calculate the elevation and azimuth
We planned how to display items on the LCD display
We discussed serialising data from python to c
We tested magnetic properties and made a plan on how to use magnets for object detection


Action items:
Get the mapping and object detection to be accurate
write a program to classify 3 different strengths of magnets and be able to identify and count each associated object
Serialise data from python to C
Work on the cohesiveness of both functions
